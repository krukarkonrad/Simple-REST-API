# RESTful API

**RESTful API** webservice that is responsible for managing and storing in database simple notes (without the UI part).
Using **MongoDB**, **Express** and **Node.js**.

## Getting Started 

We wil need some software to run and test this:

- [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) (DataBase)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) (for Testing)
- [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download) (for easy DataBase viewing, not required)

### MongoDB Configuration 

#### Create database directory

Create the data directory where MongoDB stores data. MongoDBâ€™s default data directory path is the absolute path \data\db on the drive from which you start MongoDB.

From the **Command Interpreter**, create the data directories:

    cd C:\
    md "\data\db"


#### Start your MongoDB database

To start MongoDB, run **mongod.exe**

    C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongod.exe

The last line in **CMD** should be:

    I NETWORK  [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port XXXXX

---

### Node.js Configuration

After installing Node.js, check your version by:

    >node -v
You should get your version of Node.js, my respond e.g.:

    v10.13.0

Make a root folder and drop here all files and folders from repo/root.

Folder already have required dependencies installed, you can see it in **package.json** file:


    "dependencies": {
	    "body-parser": "^1.18.3",
	    "express": "^4.16.4",
	    "mongoose": "^5.3.14"
    }

They are storage in **node_modules** folder.

---

Now You should be able to run it.

Make sure that you are in a right folder in a **CMD** , e.g.:

    C:\root

Run application by:


    >node index

### Robo 3t###

We can view our dataebase in **Robo 3t** application.

Run it and Connect  to our LocalHost:

After running **Posteman**, DataBase should looks like:
